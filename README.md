### User Story

AS AN employer I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
✓ WHEN I load their portfolio THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
✓ WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
✓ WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
✓ WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
✓ WHEN I click on the images of the applications THEN I am taken to that deployed application
